# Python Basics Portfolio

Welcome to my Python Basics collection — a set of beginner-friendly Python scripts demonstrating core programming concepts such as input handling, conditionals, loops, string manipulation, and basic game logic.

## What’s Inside

This folder contains small, self-contained Python programs that each focus on a particular fundamental skill:

calculate_tip.py: Calculates total bill including user-defined tip percent, with input validation.
car_game.py: Simple text-based game to simulate starting and stopping a car.
mad_libs.py: Interactive story generator using user inputs and string formatting.
number_guess.py: Number guessing game with random number generation and input validation.
odd_or_even.py: Checks whether a user-entered number is odd or even in a loop.
palindrome.py: Tests whether a word is a palindrome using string slicing.
rock_paper_scissors.py: Classic rock-paper-scissors game against a random AI choice.
word_count.py: Counts and prints the number of words in a user-entered sentence or phrase.

## Key Concepts Covered

User input and validation
Control flow: conditionals and loops
String manipulation and formatting
Basic game mechanics and interaction
Using Python’s built-in libraries (e.g., random)

## Purpose

These projects demonstrate my ability to write clean, readable code with clear logic and effective user communication — essential skills for any software engineer. They also show a consistent approach to error handling and making programs user-friendly.
