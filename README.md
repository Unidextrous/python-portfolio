My Python Portfolio

created 02/17/2022

This is a collection of beginner projects that I made in my first month of learning Python.

I created this code myself, mostly based on the prompts from the following website:
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-projects-junior-developers/

I also decided to add some of my own personal touch to some of them, adding extra functionality or solving a problem that was not explicitly defined

My first coding language was C++, but I haven't used it in a while so my Python skills have already surpassed my C++ skills.
However, I plan to resume learning C++ and implementing it in future robotics projects.
I also plan to learn Java and other programming languages.

I'm not sure what I'd like to specialize in when I enter the workforce, but I'm especially interested in artificial intelligence and machine learning.
In fact, now that I have a pretty good handle on Python, I've started learning TensorFlow.

Thank you for reading!
